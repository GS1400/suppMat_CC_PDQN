This supplemental document provides additional results and detailed algorithmic developments supporting the main paper, titled 

An efficient penalty decomposition algorithm for minimization over sparse symmetric sets by Ahmad Mousavi, Morteza Kimiaei,

Saman Babaie–Kafaki, Vyacheslav Kungurtsev.

The material is organized as follows.

Section 2 presents explicit stationarity conditions for several convex sets used throughout the analysis.
Section 3 reviews notions of basic feasibility and L-stationarity under symmetry assumptions, and 
introduces a practical test for an approximate form of basic feasibility based on a single super-support set.
Section 4 contains the proof of Lemma 1, establishing the cone continuity property for convex symmetric sets.
Section 5 provides the complete proof of Theorem 1 using standard calculus rules for Fr\'echet normal cones.
Section 6 compares basic feasibility with various CC-stationarity concepts and clarifies their role within the stationarity hierarchy.
Section 7 describes practical enhancements to the proposed method, including an improved line search strategy and several diagonal Hessian approximations.
Section 8 summarizes sparse projection algorithms for symmetric sets.
Section 9 reports additional numerical experiments comparing different algorithmic variants.
